#DEKARAT
Dekarat is a project intended for creating a fun interactive way to record healthy habits.

The idea is simple.

You record items that are either Dubs (W) or L's (wins and losses respectively.

The idea is that you record your healthy habits easily.

The user experience is intended to be very simple to use.  With just a couple of clicks you can record an entry.

The entry can be an item from the Ws or Ls.  Each entry gives you or takes away 10 points.

You record your own Ws and Ls.  Of course someone might think, well then anyone can cheat, but who are you cheating?
As your old elementary teacher would say "When you cheat you are only cheating yourself".
